      <h4>Who We Are</h4>
      <p>
        Temz Games is a Roblox development studio built on passion, creativity, and a commitment to crafting memorable experiences. What started as a one-person effort has grown into a recognized name within the Roblox community, known for building engaging worlds and gameplay that players love returning to.
        Our studio began with Temz — a dedicated, self-taught developer who fell in love with game creation. Long before millions played our games, he was experimenting with small projects, learning new systems, and refining the ideas that would eventually become the heart of Temz Games.
      </p>
      <h4>Our Origins</h4>
      <p>
        Before there was a team or a studio name, there was just a bedroom lit by a computer screen and an endless curiosity for development. Temz spent years building mini-games, obbys, and early prototypes, each one teaching him something new about design, community expectations, and what makes a game truly fun.
        These early experiments weren’t about gaining popularity; they were stepping stones. They shaped the foundation of the studio’s approach today: start small, learn constantly, and always build with players in mind.
      </p>
      <h4>The Creation of Pet Simulator 99 X Modded</h4>
      <p>
        This philosophy led to the development of Pet Simulator 99 X Modded, the project that brought Temz Games into the spotlight. The pet simulator genre was competitive, but Temz set out to create something different — a polished, satisfying, and progression-focused experience that felt good from the very first minute of play.
        Through months of quiet work, he designed detailed worlds, collectible systems, unique pets, and balanced progression loops. When Pet Simulator 99 X Modded launched, players immediately noticed the care put into the game, and it quickly became one of the studio’s defining titles.
      </p>
      <h4>Innovation Behind the Scenes</h4>
      <p>
        As the community grew, so did our ambition. While the main game evolved, Temz continued exploring new ideas and testing features behind the scenes. Some of these concepts became future updates; others became experimental projects shared only with a small group of trusted testers.
        This spirit of experimentation remains a key part of how we work. We believe that creativity thrives when developers are free to explore bold ideas, try new mechanics, and push the boundaries of what Roblox experiences can offer.
      </p>
      <h4>Our Philosophy</h4>
      <p>
        At Temz Games, we focus on three core values:

        • Player-first design — Everything we create starts with the question: “Is this fun?”
        • Constant improvement — We’re always learning, testing, and refining our approach.
        • Creativity and curiosity — Innovation comes from staying curious and never settling.

        We believe games should feel rewarding, intuitive, and built with care — not rushed or filled with unnecessary complexity. That philosophy guides every project we work on, big or small.
      </p>
      <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
      <p>
        Today, Temz Games continues to grow, with new ideas, new projects, and a community that inspires us every day. While the studio has expanded beyond its one-person beginnings, the core spirit remains unchanged: passionate development, attention to detail, and a love for creating experiences that bring players together.
        We’re excited for the future — new worlds, new features, and new ways to deliver fun. Whether you’ve been with us since the early days or just joined the community, we’re glad you’re here.
      </p>
      <h4>Our Mission</h4>
      <p>
        To create games that are fun, imaginative, and built with the player at the heart of every decision.
